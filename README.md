Configure payment provider in the `pimcore_ecommerce_config.payment_manager` config section: 
```yaml

    payment_manager:
        # service ID of payment manager implementation - following value is default value an can be omitted
        payment_manager_id: Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\PaymentManager\PaymentManager

        # configuration of payment providers, key is name of provider
        providers:
            ogone:
                provider_id: Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\PaymentManager\Payment\OGone
                profile: sandbox
                profiles:
                    sandbox:
                        secretIn: D343DDFD3434
                        secretOut: E454EEGE4545
                        pspid: MyTestAccount
                        mode: sandbox                        
#                       encryptionType: SHA1 or SHA256 or SHA512 (optional)
                    live:
                        secretIn: D343DDFD3434
                        secretOut: E454EEGE4545
                        mode: live                        
#                       encryptionType: SHA1 or SHA256 or SHA512 (optional)
```

Payment Information: Order payment section "Payment Informations" stores information about every payment trial by Customer.

Add additional fields in "PaymentInfo" fieldcollection, so that Order Manager stores information in Order object:

## Implementation

Somewhere in your checkout controller you will need to create the payment configuration for the `initPayment()`
method of the provider:

```php
<?php
    $url = 'https://'. $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . "/en/checkout/confirm?state=";
    $paymentConfig = [                   
                    'language'            => "en",
                    'orderIdent'          => $paymentInfo->getInternalPaymentId(),                   
                    'customerStatement'   => $paymentMessage,
                    'successUrl'          => "https://my-server-name.com/shop/payment/confirm?provider=ogone&state=success",
                    'cancelUrl'           => "https://my-server-name.com/shop/payment/confirm?provider=ogone&state=cancel",
                    'errorUrl'            => "https://my-server-name.com/shop/payment/confirm?provider=ogone&state=error",
                    'paymentInfo'         => $order->getPaymentInfo()->getItems()[0]
                ];
```

You must configure the callback URLs within the OGone backend so that these are called server-by-server.

You can pass additional parameters in the configuration based on the OGone documentation. For instance the color and 
the appearance of th Ogone UI can be controlled, and additional customer data may be passed.
